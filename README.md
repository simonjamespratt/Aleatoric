# AleatoricCompositionTools

A static library written in C++ which implements algorithms commonly used in computer-aided music composition. The project is inspired by the library [Real Time Composition Library](http://www.essl.at/works/rtc.html) (RTC-lib) by Karlheinz Essl for use with the [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max) environment.

The project is still in its infancy and is not functional. Further details will be added here in due course.
